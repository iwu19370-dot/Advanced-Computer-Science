Unit 5.7 Lab — Card Game
Card Game Lab: Build-a-Deck + Abstract Classes + Interfaces
In this lab, you will create your own 5-card deck and battle a bot deck.

You will practice:

Abstract classes — Card is abstract; CardGranite, CardParchment, and CardBlade extend it
Interfaces — Ability is an interface; AbilityBastion, AbilityRipple, AbilityCleave, and AbilityNone implement it
Polymorphism — declaring variables as Card or Ability while the actual objects are specific subclasses/implementations
ArrayList, loops, Scanner, and Random
Class Hierarchy Overview
        Card (abstract class)
       /        |         \
 CardGranite  CardParchment  CardBlade
   (extends)   (extends)     (extends)


        Ability (interface)
       /      |        \         \
 AbilityBastion  AbilityRipple  AbilityCleave  AbilityNone
 (implements)    (implements)   (implements)   (implements)
Each Card holds a single Ability reference — this is composition (a Card HAS-A Ability). The card's type is determined by which subclass it is (a CardGranite IS-A Card).

How the Game Works
Each player has a deck of 5 cards.
Each player can have only 1 active card at a time.
On your turn:
If you have no active card, draw the next card from your deck and play it (its ability triggers).
Your active card then attacks the opponent's active card (if they have one).
When a card's health reaches 0 or less, it is defeated and removed from play.
If you have no active card AND no cards left in your deck, you lose.
Card Stats + Limits
Each card has:

Name: any single word
Type: Granite, Parchment, or Blade (determines which subclass to create)
Strength: 1–5 (base attack damage)
Health: 1–5 (how much damage the card can take)
Stat limit: strength + health <= 6 (example: 3/3 is valid, 4/3 is not)
Ability: one of Bastion, Ripple, Cleave, or None
Type Advantage (Rock-Paper-Scissors)
Damage is multiplied by the type matchup (see TypeChart.java):

Attacker	vs Defender	Multiplier
Granite	Blade	2x
Granite	Parchment	0.5x
Parchment	Granite	2x
Parchment	Blade	0.5x
Blade	Parchment	2x
Blade	Granite	0.5x
Same type	Same type	1x
When damage is halved (0.5x), the result is rounded up (e.g., 3 * 0.5 = 2).

Abilities
Each card has exactly one Ability (which may be AbilityNone for no effect).

There are 3 real abilities:

BASTION (AbilityBastion)

When played: gain 2 shield (shield absorbs damage before health is reduced)
RIPPLE (AbilityRipple)

When played: deal 1 damage to the opponent's active card
If opponent has no active card, store it as pending damage applied to their next drawn card
Then cycle: move this card to the bottom of your deck and immediately draw your next card (if any)
CLEAVE (AbilityCleave)

When played: gain +2 bonus damage added to every attack this card makes
Deck Ability Rules
No more than 3 total ability cards in the deck
No more than 1 of each ability in the deck (at most one Bastion, one Ripple, one Cleave)
Your Tasks (What You Implement)
You will implement two files:

1) DeckValidator.java
Checker methods — each returns true if the deck passes the rule:

checkNoMoreThanThreeAbilityCards(deck) — at most 3 cards with abilities
Hint: use card.hasAbility() to check if a card has a real ability
checkNoDuplicateAbilities(deck) — no two cards share the same ability
Hint: use card.getAbility().getId() to get the ability name ("BASTION", "RIPPLE", "CLEAVE", or "NONE")
checkStatsInRange(deck) — strength and health are each 1–5, and strength + health <= 6
Hint: use card.getStrength() and card.getHealth()
isValidDeck(deck) — returns true only if the deck has exactly 5 cards AND all checks pass
Deck builder methods:

buildDefaultDeck() — creates 5 cards, all 3/3, no abilities
Use the card subclasses directly (e.g. new CardGranite(...)) or the createCard() helper
buildUserDeck(scanner) — prompts the user 5 times to build their deck (see Input Format below)
2) CardBattleGame.java
Game loop:

Coin flip to decide who goes first (use Random)
int randomInt = rng.nextInt();  // use even/odd or positive/negative to pick
Each turn: draw & play if no active card, then attack
Apply abilities correctly (shield, ping, cycle, bonus damage)
Attack using type multipliers (see card.computeDamageAgainst(defender))
Detect when a player has no cards left (active or in deck)
Print output:
== CARD CLASH ==
Starting: Player    (or "Starting: Bot")
Winner: Player      (or "Winner: Bot")
Useful methods for your implementation:

Method	What it does
card.applySelfOnPlay()	Applies shield and bonus damage from the card's ability
card.getAbility().pingDamageOnPlay()	How much ping damage this ability deals (0 or 1)
card.getAbility().cyclesOnPlay()	Whether the card cycles to the bottom of the deck
card.computeDamageAgainst(defender)	Calculates damage with type multipliers
card.takeDamage(amount)	Reduces shield first, then health
card.isDefeated()	true if health <= 0
card.getType()	Returns CardType (uses polymorphism!)
state.getDeck()	Returns the player's ArrayList<Card>
state.getActive() / setActive(card)	The currently active card (or null)
state.hasAnythingLeft()	true if active card exists or cards remain in deck
state.getPendingDamage() / setPendingDamage(int)	Stored Ripple damage for next drawn card
Input Format for buildUserDeck
For each of the 5 cards, prompt in this order:

Name — a single word (String)
Type — granite, parchment, or blade
Strength — an integer 1–5
Health — an integer 1–5
Ability — bastion, ripple, cleave, or none
Use CardType.fromText() to parse the type and AbilityLibrary.fromText() to parse the ability. Then use createCard(name, type, strength, health, ability) to build the right subclass.

If any input is invalid (bad type, out-of-range stats, strength + health > 6), reprompt until valid.
